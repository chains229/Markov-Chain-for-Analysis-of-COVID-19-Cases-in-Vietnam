# Markov Chain Model for Analysis of COVID-19 Cases in Vietnam

COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is highly contagious, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants. This type of virus was first discovered in Wuhan, China, and appeared in Vietnam for the first time on January 23, 2020. The virus causes acute respiratory inflammation in humans and can spread directly from person to person. As of October 20, 2022, Vietnam has recorded over 11.5 million cases of COVID-19 and more than 43,000 deaths. This study utilizes a discrete-time Markov chain model to simulate the number of new COVID-19 cases each week in Vietnam. A Markov chain is a random process that satisfies the Markov property: it's a process in which future outcomes can be predicted solely based on the current state, without needing the entire history to determine the current state. The Markov chain model can reach a steady-state, where a state vector's values remain constant over time. The study uses data on new COVID-19 cases in Vietnam from January 1, 2020, to November 1, 2022. Using the Markov chain model in a steady-state, it's observed that the highest occurrence of new COVID-19 cases in a week in Vietnam is under 20,000, with a probability of 0.6986. The research findings can provide valuable insights to the government and policymakers for crafting plans and policies to respond to the epidemic.
